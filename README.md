# Lilak, Persian Spell Checking Dictionary

[Lilak](https://github.com/m-o-s-t-a-f-a/lilak) is an open source project for generating Persian dictionary for [hunspell](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell) spell checker based on Persian Morphology. 
In Persian language affixes can change the meaning of the word. Some suffixes attached to a word as short form of verbs. For detecting these suffixes we need to know the part-of-speech and in some cases the exact pronunciation of the word.
Lilak has a lexicon of Persian words with part-of-speech tags. Lilak builds a dictionary for hunspell to predict the best form of compound words based on morphological rules.
Lilak works under Python3.

```
pip install hunspell
```
To test Lilak, run dotest.py from 'test' folder:
```
python dotest.py
```
You can find the result at 'result.log' file

##How to contribute

The best way that you can contribute on this project is collecting words with 
part-of-speech tags. It will help me to make dictionary more useful and accurate.

Part-of-speech is important to build lilak.
It should classified in main types like: verb, noun, adjective, ...
Also some other tags will be useful. like tense of verb, singular or plural, ...
Check Lexicon for more information
